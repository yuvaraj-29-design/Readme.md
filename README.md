# Student Exam Performance Predictor

## Summary
This project uses machine learning to predict student exam performance based on study hours, sleep hours, and previous grades. The goal is to help students understand which factors most affect their results and take corrective action.

## Problem
Many students struggle to improve academic performance because they don't know how different habits (like study time or sleep) affect their results.

## Solution
We built a supervised machine learning model using regression to predict student scores. The data includes features like:
- Study Hours
- Sleep Duration
- Past Scores

The model predicts final scores and provides feature importance.

## Tools Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Results
- Achieved 82% accuracy on test data
- Found that study hours had the highest impact on scores
