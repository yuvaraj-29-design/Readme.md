#🎓 Student Performance Predictor using AI

##summary

This project is a machine learning-based solution designed to predict student academic performance levels — such as *Excellent*, *Good*, *Average*, or *At Risk* — using minimal input features like **attendance**, **internal assessment scores**, and **weekly study hours**.

The model helps in early identification of underperforming students to assist educators with timely interventions and academic planning.

## 📌 Features

- Uses a **Random Forest Classifier** for multi-class prediction  
- Trained on a sample academic dataset  
- Input features: Attendance %, Internal Score, Study Hours  
- Output categories: Excellent, Good, Average, At Risk  
- Executed in **Google Colab** for cloud accessibility  
- Simple prediction function for new data

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **Google Colab**  
- **Scikit-learn** – ML modeling  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data handling  
- **Joblib** – Model saving/loading  
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** – Visualization (optional)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Load dataset (CSV with attendance, scores, and hours)
2. Encode performance labels using LabelEncoder
3. Train a Random Forest model on 70% of the data
4. Predict student performance category
5. Evaluate model using accuracy score and confusion matrix

## 📊 Model Accuracy

- Achieved **~89% accuracy** on test data  
- Feature importance ranking:
  1. Internal Score
  2. Attendance
  3. Study Hours

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Add behavioral and psychological inputs (e.g., engagement, stress levels)  
- Integrate with LMS platforms for real-time data  
- Deploy as a web app (Streamlit/Flask)  
- Expand dataset to improve model generalization
